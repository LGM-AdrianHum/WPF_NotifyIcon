# WPF_NotifyIcon

This is an alternative implementation of a NotifyIcon (system tray icon) for the WPF platform. It does not just rely on the corresponding WinForms component, but is a purely independent control which leverages several features of the WPF framework in order to display rich tooltips, popups, context menus, and balloon messages.

* Rich ToolTips rather than text  
* WPF context menus and popups
* Command support and routed events 
* Flexible data binding  
* Rich balloon messages rather than the default messages provides by the OS
